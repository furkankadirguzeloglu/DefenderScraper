# DefenderScraper
An open source permanent Windows Defender uninstaller.

## Features
- Permanently deletes Windows Defender and can no longer be enabled.
- It works automatically, you don't need to do any additional action.
- If defender is disabled after the latest Windows 11 and Windows 10 updates (KB5022845, KB5022360..), there is a loss of performance. This solves the problem, supports all updates and no performance degradation.
> If you have disabled it before and you are experiencing performance problems after the latest updates, first enable it with ["Defender Control"](https://www.sordum.org/9480/defender-control-v2-1/), then restart your system and use the ["DefenderScraper"](https://github.com/furkankadirguzeloglu/DefenderScraper) software. Your problem will be solved.
